        <h3>"Jingle Dress"</h3>   
        <p>The Jingle Dress come to the Anishinabeg people as a healing dress.
        It is meant for only young girls, women to wear as that is how the spirits see it.
        The dress is made up of cloth, ribbon sewed down across the bottom half & maybe some on the top of dress, bias tape 
        is strung up with jingles attached under the sewed ribbon. This contains multiple rows of jingles on the dress, as
        one dances you can hear the harmony come to a life of its own.</p>

        <h3>"Star Quilt"</h3>
        <p>I believe Star Quilt blankets got started among the Sioux when the men could'nt hunt the women sewed blankets for income.
        As there sewing quilts skills enhanced they designed the Lone Star which is known today also as Star Quilt blanket.
        I enjoy sewing it brings relaxation, peace and one can learn patience. As a single parent raising four childre I needed to 
        learn patience. The more I sewed on Star Quilts the faster, more precise my skills got. The community began to get word of 
        my star quilts, regalia. I started receiving requests I was able to bring income into my home, family.</p>
