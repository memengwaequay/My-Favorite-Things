        <h3>"Jingle Dress"</h3>
        <p>The Jingle Dress come to the Anishinabeg people as a healing dress.
        It is meant for only young girls, women to wear as that is how the spirits see it.
        The dress is made up of cloth, bias tape strung up on jingles attached under ribbon or bias tape to the cloth for dress. 
        This contains multiple rows of jingles on the dress, as one dances you can hear the harmony come to a life of its own.</p>

        <h3>"Star Quilt"</h3>
        <p>I believe Star Quilt blankets got started among the Sioux when the men could'nt hunt bison the women sewed blankets for income.
        As there sewing quilts skills enhanced they designed the Lone Star which is known today also as Star Quilt blanket.
        I enjoy sewing it brings relaxation, peace and one can learn patience. With .raising four children as a
        single parent I needed to learn patience. The more I sewed on Star Quilts the faster, more precise my skills got. The community 
        began to get word of my star quilts, regalia. I started receiving requests I was able to bring income into my home, family.</p>
